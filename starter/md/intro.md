I'm sure you'll like it here. It was made for you.

I made this because I spend a fair amount of time writing websites that consist of just one page, hosted on a subdomain of my main site:
- [wa.joodaloop.com](https://wa.joodaloop.com)
- [mac.joodaloop.com](https://mac.joodaloop.com)
- [map.joodaloop.com](https://map.joodaloop.com)
- [webcraft.joodaloop.com](https://webcraft.joodaloop.com)
- [hypertext.joodaloop.com](https://hypertext.joodaloop.com)

And I end up wishing for a few nicities while authoring the `index.html` page that makes up the site. Things like...
- Copying over the right `<meta>` tags with the site details
- Remembering to add social media card images
- Syntax highlighting for codeblocks
- Mixing HTML with Markdown
- Live page reload

So that's what Pager provides, **the best `index.html` authoring experience** I could come up with, for those of us who still do things by hand sometimes.
